The slim booklet called *Guyana Drums* was, according to journalist Petamber Persaud, the "first anthology" of female Guyanese poets, produced on the occasion of CARIFESTA ‘72 in Guyana. The poets were Syble Douglas, Pat Cameron, Sheila King, Evadne d'Oliveira, Mitzie Townsend, and Shana Yardan. These six contributing authors, so the story goes, got together to publish their work because "not every writer could be featured" in Arthur Seymour’s official festival anthology, New Writing in the Caribbean. The book was self-published and printed in small numbers. Today it is hard to find; only four academic libraries in the world possess a copy. No doubt it remains in the personal collections of people who attended CARIFESTA. The music of these six drummers will continue to be heard.

The cover of this poetry collection was designed by one of the six contributing poets and the author of the book’s title poem, Syble Douglas. She was a woman of many talents. According to her [obituary](https://www.dodsandmcnair.com/memorials/syble-douglas/4293401/obit.php?&printable=true), Douglas (1926-2020) studied visual arts and "was one of the first female journalists, with her own column ‘Just between us’ and edited the Woman’s Page and the social columns at the now-defunct *Daily Argosy* newspaper." As an advocate of women’s issues in the early days of Guyanese independence, she was also "involved in the precursor of the Guyana Women Artists Association." Curator Elfrieda Bissember notes that she founded Georgetown's first private art gallery, the Malcara Art Gallery, in 1969. A short entry on her life was included in the 1979 book *Caribbean writers: a bio-bibliographical-critical encyclopedia*. There we learn that Douglas was also a playwright. She continued to write poetry throughout her life and published her last collection of poems, *Transition*, in 2008.

In the form of a foreword, *Guyana Drums* received the endorsement of Prime Minister Forbes Burnham’s wife Viola Burnham, a classics teacher and the Vice-Chairperson of the Women's Auxiliary of the ruling party, the People’s National Congress. Still, the book was not an officially sponsored festival publication with a serious budget. This speaks to the persistent inequality that women politicians and poets faced in Guyana at the time.
