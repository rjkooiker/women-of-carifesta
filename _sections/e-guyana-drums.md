According to journalist Petamber Persaud, this slim booklet was the “first anthology” of female Guyanese poets, produced on the occasion of CARIFESTA ‘72 in Guyana. The poets were Syble Douglas, Pat Cameron, Sheila King, Evadne d'Oliveira, Mitzie Townsend, and Shana Yardan. These six contributing authors got together to publish their work because “not every writer could be featured” in Arthur Seymour’s official festival anthology, *New Writing in the Caribbean*. The book was self-published and with only a few copies printed. While only four academic libraries in the world possess a copy, it no doubt remains in the personal collections of people who attended CARIFESTA. The music of these six drummers will continue to be heard.

The cover of this poetry collection was designed by one of the six contributing poets and the author of the book’s title poem, Syble Douglas. She was a woman of many talents. Douglas (1926-2020) studied visual arts and her painting "Still Life with Pineapple" was featured in the CARIFESTA '72 arts exhibit.[^guyana-drums-1] She was also one of Guyana's first female journalists. Her column ‘Just between us' appeared in the now-defunct *Daily Argosy* newspaper, where she also edited the Woman’s Page.[^guyana-drums-2] Curator Elfrieda Bissember notes that she founded Georgetown's first private art gallery, the Malcara Art Gallery, in 1969. A short entry on her life was included in the 1979 book *Caribbean writers: a bio-bibliographical-critical encyclopedia*. There we learn that Douglas was also a playwright. She continued to write poetry throughout her life and published her last collection of poems, *Transition*, in 2008.

In the form of a foreword, *Guyana Drums* received the endorsement of Prime Minister Forbes Burnham’s wife Viola Burnham. She was a classics teacher and the Vice-Chairperson of the Women's Auxiliary of the ruling party, the People’s National Congress. Still, the book was not an officially sponsored festival publication with a serious budget. This speaks to the persistent inequality that women politicians and poets faced in Guyana at the time.

The book title Guyana Drums calls on women to take their place in the drum circle, an instrument traditionally reserved for men. It encourages women to take up space and make noise. The book envisions a role for women to sound the beats and create the rhythms of national progress.
