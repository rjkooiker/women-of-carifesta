## Introduction: Women of Carifesta

Chances are that you haven’t heard of the Caribbean Festival of Arts, one of the largest regional festivals of culture in the Caribbean. Starting in Guyana in 1972, the festival has traveled widely around the region over its 50-year history, including editions in Jamaica, Barbados, Cuba, Suriname, and Trinidad & Tobago. As scholars learn more about the history of this festival, it’s becoming clear that it could never have happened without the artistic contributions and organizational work of Caribbean women. Despite prevailing inequalities and bias, women at Carifesta also found opportunities to launch their careers and stage their art in front of thousands. 

This exhibit sheds light on many of those women for the first time, ranging from the first festival in Guyana to the 1981 festival in Barbados. Focusing on these women's work and voices shows how many of the Carifesta events elevated the work of men and heroic masculinity as ideals the region’s people should strive toward, often excluding women in the process. When women were featured, they had stereotypes to contend with–even well-known artists such as Louise Bennett. 

This exhibit displays original historical documents and recordings, offering insights into Carifesta’s past. However, existing Carifesta archives often skew toward that male-centric view. That’s why, along with deep archival research, I’ve conducted interviews with women who were first-hand witnesses and participants in the events of Carifesta. Their memories can go beyond paper traces and bring the festivals to life.
