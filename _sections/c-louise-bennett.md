Louise Bennett was a legendary Jamaican storyteller, poet, radio personality, and cultural activist. She attended four CARIFESTA editions held from 1972-1981. She was given a place of honor at the CARIFESTA opening ceremonies of Guyana in 1972 and in Cuba in 1979 as a leader of the Jamaican delegations. A news article documenting her arrival in Guyana, where she met with festival Commissioner Frank Pilgrim in a “V.I.P. lounge,” also describes the Olympic Village-style “Festival City,” which housed the distinguished visitors. There, the article continues, "specially trained maids have already moved in with their brooms and other paraphenalia [sic] to provide a spic and span welcome."[^louise-bennett-1] This contrast between working-class Caribbean women hired to cater to the needs of middle-class performers who are seen as their 'voices', the protectors of lower-class folk traditions, was a poignant reminder of the societal divisions in Guyana.

One of Guyana’s flagship performances during the festival was the variety show *All Kinds of Folk*. The show highlighted the diversity of Guyana’s communities, descendants from African, Indian, Chinese, and other ethnicities–all of whom were brought there under the duress of enslavement or indentured servitude. Miss Lou’s performance during *All Kinds of Folk* was a hit, inspiring rave reviews in the press.⁠[^louise-bennett-2] Her brilliance saved a reportedly "ponderous" and heavy-handed production from "lethargy" and forgettability.⁠[^louise-bennett-3]

Stealing Guyanese hearts, Miss Lou appeared during *All Kinds of Folk* with her Guyanese "sister," poet-performer Aunty Cumsee (a.k.a. Pauline Thomas), whom the newspapers called "Guyana’s answer to Jamaica’s Miss Lou." A caption below the picture of the women greeting on stage cites the Jamaican Mento song Auntie Cumsee performed for Miss Lou, "LANG TIME GAL ME NEVAH SEE YOU."⁠ As the original song (usually titled "Dis Long Time, Gal") is about the reunification of old friends or lovers, Cumsee’s homage to Miss Lou infuses this first-time meeting of the two performers with a backstory, as if they had been sisters or best friends all along. One critic even compared this "touching moment" between Thomas and Bennett to a rekindling of "the spirit of the West Indies Federation."⁠[^louise-bennett-4] The singer’s invitation to "come mek me hol your han" doubles as a diplomatic handshake.

Bennett ventured beyond the confines of her V.I.P. housing and the festival venues, taking her performance to the streets and nightclubs of Georgetown. Barbara Gloudon, the Jamaican journalist and playwright—herself a patois pioneer, using it in her newspaper columns—was housed next to Bennett at Echilibar Villas. Miss Lou acted like the consummate celebrity that she was, venturing beyond the barred-off spaces of government officials to mingle with the ordinary people of Guyana. Gloudon’s description highlights the reciprocity of gift-giving between Miss Lou and her "fans." Her personality transcended languages with laughter. Walking around the market, where she sets so many of her scenes, Miss Lou brought her "labrishes" to life. Her proximity to these market women echoes the history of marketplaces in plantation societies such as Guyana and Jamaica, where enslaved, and runaway women would work as "higglers" in a state of "provisional freedom within slavery."⁠[^louise-bennett-5] In the temporary spaces of spontaneity created during the festival, Bennett became Miss Lou, the authentic embodiment of the people’s voice.

For Carifesta ’79 in Cuba, Bennett was once again a specially honored guest. She had been invited to write and recite new work at the opening ceremony in the national stadium, sharing the stage with Nicolás Guillén, Robin "Dobru" Ravales, and Edward Kamau Brathwaite. Her performance of her new poem, "Carifesta Rydim," was partially captured in Errol Brewster’s film recordings of the Carifesta ’79 opening night.

Bennett’s verse finds communality in Caribbean rhythm and performance. That much is not surprising for readers of Caribbean poetry. But notice her wordplay on the processes of stirring, blending, turning, shaking, and tempering, and the final punchline of a "ridim" that is "sweet." Her puns blend the techniques of cooking with the devices of poetry (tempering becomes tempo, the rhythmic beat evokes the beating of batter, and turning becomes tune).
