The Caribbean Festival of Arts, also known as CARIFESTA, is one of the largest regional festivals of arts and culture in the Caribbean. Starting in Guyana in 1972, the festival has traveled widely around the region for over 50 years. Countries that have hosted the festival include Jamaica, Barbados, Cuba, Suriname, and Trinidad & Tobago. As we learn more about the history of this festival, it becomes clear that CARIFESTA could have never happened without the artistic contributions and organizational work of Caribbean women. Despite prevailing inequalities and biases, women at CARIFESTA also found opportunities to launch their careers and stage their art in front of thousands.

Focusing on these women's voices shows how many CARIFESTA events elevated men’s work and heroic masculinity as ideals communities should strive toward. This often excluded women in the process. When women were featured in the festival, they had stereotypes to contend with–even well-known artists such as Louise Bennett.

This exhibit sheds light on the women of CARIFESTA by displaying original historical documents and recordings that range from the first 1972 festival in Guyana to the 1981 festival in Barbados. Existing Carifesta archives often skew toward a male-centric view. Therefore, this exhibit also offers interviews with women who were first-hand witnesses and participants in the events of CARIFESTA. Their memories can go beyond paper and bring the festivals to life.
