Though she would become well-known as a generational talent in Jamaican poetry, and now has a five-decade career and a much-lauded body of work behind her, Lorna Goodison started her creative life as a visual artist. After studies at the Jamaica School of Art and a stint at The Art Students League of New York (taking a course with no less than Jacob Lawrence), she cobbled together odd jobs in public relations and advertising. A lesser known fact about her life is that she worked for the advertising firm contracted to do promotional work for Carifesta 1976 in Jamaica. She later became the festival’s official "Advertising Consultant." This is the story of the work she did for Carifesta and the memories of the festival she still cherishes. "The way everybody in the arts just took part in it—it was quite stunning," she said.

In 1976, Goodison was working for a company called Don Miller & Associates. In an interview with the curator, she recounted how she "just went to work one day, and we’re told that the Carifesta people want us to handle the advertising. And I was just really chuffed because it was the greatest thing." However, she continued, "in the middle of all of this, the company we were working for collapsed. It was the 70s, and there was a lot of political upheaval going on. He [company director Don Miller] decides he’s going to go back to Canada. But I wanted to do it so badly, so I joined the staff at the Carifesta Secretariat, as a sort of writer. There are a number of things I’ve written—brochures, anything that uses writing like that."

The slogan "People of the Sun in all their Glory" was everywhere at Carifesta; and it was Goodison’s idea. "That was my slogan!" she exclaimed. The slogan was also used as the title for Wycliffe Bennett’s monumental Carifesta Grand Gala at the festival’s close. With the Carifesta Secretariat, Goodison organized anything to do with copywriting. Other people handled the visual side. "That poster was done by a friend of mine named Howard Salmon, he was sort of the main artist in the agency at the time." Reminiscent of Matisse’s bright color cutouts, the iconography of the abstracted sun and waves adorned all official festival publications. The top right section of the illustration shows stylized portraits of the five Carifesta ‘patron saints’: Toussaint L’Ouverture, Benito Juárez, José Martí, Marcus Garvey, and Simón Bolívar.

The Secretariat also commissioned a promotional film for Carifesta, just as Guyana had done for the previous edition. "I worked on a long-ish promotional film," Goodison recalled. "It was done by Franklyn St Juste. He taught at the Media Studies department at UWI, a pioneer in film in the Caribbean. He was the director. I wrote it and was the producer. We went to Haiti, Trinidad, and St Lucia, and shot footage for this promotional film." Franklyn "Chappy" St Juste was one of Jamaica’s distinguished cinematographers at the time. He had worked on the international hit film *The Harder They Come* (1972) and had filmed Ethiopian ruler Haile Selassie’s legendary visit to Jamaica in 1966. Unfortunately, the film has been lost.

Most of Goodison’s many siblings were involved in the arts in some way. "My sister Barbara Gloudon was deputy Director of Tourism at that time, and they made a real push to reach out to the African American market. I really like that ad because it highlights the arts, not just sea, sun and sand." (Above, see Gloudon’s column on the Guyana 1972 festival.) Other ads were placed in the Washington Post and the Chicago Tribune. The promotional campaign also included a high-profile fundraiser, with Louise Bennett performing for a distinguished audience of paying guests and Jamaican embassy officials at the New York Waldorf Astoria, which had been organized by the "CARIFESTA Committee of the Americas."[^lorna-goodison-1] Her status as national icon was sure to draw crowds willing to pay the $25 ticket price and encourage them to travel as tourists to Jamaica.

One more task in Goodison’s packed Carifesta portfolio was to help with the printing of books. She provided work for two of the pivotal volumes that appeared on the occasion: Edward Kamau Brathwaite’s *Our Ancestral Heritage: A bibliography of the roots of Culture in the English-speaking Caribbean* and John Hearne’s *Carifesta Forum*. While Hearne did not acknowledge her work in print, Brathwaite expressed his appreciation to Goodison "for cover design and graphics." Goodison was one of the many women employed in Jamaica’s arts and printing businesses, without whom these books could never have seen the light of day, but whose essential contributions have been overlooked.
