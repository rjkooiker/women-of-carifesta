In 1966, the Prime Minister of Guyana, Forbes Burnham, delivered a speech to Caribbean artists and writers. This speech is often considered the origin of the CARIFESTA festival idea. While no women were recorded as attending this meeting, Lynette deWeever Dolphin, Joan Cambridge, Magda Pollard, and Shirley Field-Ridley played crucial roles in organizing CARIFESTA ‘72.

The second-ever Guyanese recipient of a scholarship to attend London’s Royal Academy of Music, Lynette Dolphin was an anthologist of Guyanese folk music. She was also an accomplished pianist who performed with the ensemble for the “Legend of Kaieteur,” the Guyanese chorale by Philip Pilgrim. For many years, she led the Guyanese National History and Arts Council.

In 1970, Burnham organized a second meeting of Caribbean artists and writers to formulate policy recommendations for the festival. Lynette Dolphin chaired the Music and Dance Sub-Committee. As the official CARIFESTA Secretariat was assembled, she became CARIFESTA Director.

In preparation for CARIFESTA, Dolphin visited Caribbean and Latin American countries, including Suriname, Chile, Peru, and Brazil. She persuaded governments to send their best artists to Guyana. She also asked numerous writers to send contributions to the CARIFESTA anthology of Caribbean literature.

During her time abroad, Dolphin spent two weeks in Brazil. The *Ballet Folclórico Viva Bahia*, part of the Brazilian delegation, was one of the most anticipated groups to perform at CARIFESTA. After touring their new choreography *Odoiá Bahia: A Folk-Pop Spectacle* around Brazil, which included elements of *capoeira*, *candomblé*, and *samba de roda*, the group took their two-hour show to the CARIFESTA stage. Recognizing Dolphin’s efforts, a member of the group gifted her a bouquet of flowers at the CARIFESTA closing ceremonies.

Based on the success of CARIFESTA ‘72, the Cuban government invited Dolphin to Havana to advise on preparations for the 1979 edition of CARIFESTA. During that festival, Edward Kamau Brathwaite, Barbadian poet and frequent CARIFESTA participant, had called her the "MOTHER OF CARIFESTA."[^lynette-dolphin-1]
