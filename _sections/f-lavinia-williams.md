Lavinia Williams, an African-American dancer, was an important representative of Haiti during CARIFESTA. By the 1950s, Williams had become a distinguished figure in the performing arts world as a member of Katherine Dunham’s touring company. In April 1953, Williams moved to Haiti after being invited for a six-month teaching gig by Haitian officials. With her technical prowess and training, she promised to modernize and universalize traditional Haitian vodou dance forms.

She founded the Haitian Academy of Folklore and Classic Dance during this time.[^lavinia-williams-1] Her legacy is troubled, however, by the violent and repressive government  of François “Papa Doc” Duvalier and his son Jean-Claude “Baby Doc.” Like them, she romanticized and used *vodou* to excuse the impoverishment of the Haitian people. She told a CARIFESTA reporter: “Many people have always wondered why, although Haitians are poor materially, there is no crime wave, riots, strikes and labour unrest in their country, but the reason for this social phenomenon is voodoo.”[^lavinia-williams-2] Nothing could be farther from the truth–not only was there plenty of unrest in Haiti during the Duvalier era, but throughout Haitian history, *vodou* has served as a catalyst of revolt.

Williams attended CARIFESTA 1972 in Guyana as manager and choreographer of Haiti’s National Ballet Company (Ballet d’Haiti). The company  sent fourteen dancers to the festival. However, the Guyanese reception of Williams’ work repeated certain stereotypes. For instance, the caption to the newspaper illustration of Williams’ dance minimized the difference between her stylized version of Haitian traditional dance movements and the real-life ritual. 

Another article called Haiti a “Fairyland of Voodoo Drums and Strange Ritual Dance.”[^lavinia-williams-3] 

In a festival profile of Williams, a journalist wrote: “We in this part of the world tend to regard voodooism with a mixture of fear, curiosity - and amusement, but if you ask Lavinia about casting spells and sticking pins into dolls, she would frown seriously and proceed to give you a disquisition on the influence of the voo-doo cult on the nation of Haiti.” Guyanese culture was no less influenced by African religious practices. This is evident, for instance, in the drums and dances of Cumfa (or Komfa). One then wonders how and why these stereotypes persisted in Guyana.

Williams herself did not dance during the festival.  She told reporters that she wouldn’t dance, “since I have to do all the stage managing and the reading on stage before the dances and I also have to overlook costumes and equipment.” Through the performanceWilliams wanted to combat the ignorance about Haiti that was prevalent in the Caribbean. Her choreographies were not just symbolic but also based on Haitian history. One of them was a “dance based on the revolution of 1791 featuring the acts of a rebel slave Boukinan [Boukman].”[^lavinia-williams-4] Williams refers to Boukman, one of the leaders of the Haitian revolution who, together with Cécile Fatiman, presided over the religious ceremony at Bois Caïman that launched the revolt.

Also part of Williams’ busy Carifesta schedule was her morning dance masterclass at the Guyana Teachers’ Association. According to the festival timetable, she held her dance classes between 10am and 12.30pm. She was scheduled to lead eight workshops, but the Haitian delegation was called back by the government five days before the festival’s ending. She, therefore,  handed her last three sessions over to a fellow African-American dancer, Chuck Davis.[^lavinia-williams-5] He recalled the situation in an interview, many years later:

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p> While I was there [at CARIFESTA], Lavinia Williams was teaching Haitian dance forms as a part of the series. The government called her back to Haiti. And she saw me and she says, “Chuck, I have to go back to Haiti, take over my classes, I don’t want to cancel,” so she said, “will you take over my classes?” So they made arrangements for somebody to pick me up from where I was then and I came over [...]. I wasn’t teaching Haitian! I was teaching what I knew was dance, and at that point you know their traditions, and the class was exciting, and she had about twelve, and after the third day I had about 40 people.</p>
</blockquote>

Her masterclass was so popular and successful that Williams promised to return to Guyana as a teacher. Reportedly, she was "so impressed with the natural aptitude of the Guyanese people for music and dancing that she is hoping to start classes locally at the National Cultural Centre or the University of Guyana to teach voodoo dancing and drumming.”[^lavinia-williams-6] Many of her students have spoken about her enduring legacy in Guyanese dance.[^lavinia-williams-7]
