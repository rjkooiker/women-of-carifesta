Seemingly everywhere and nowhere, Marina Maxwell (née Archbald-Crichlow) is one of the unsung greats of Caribbean feminism and cultural activism. Born in Jamaica in 1934, she traveled widely in Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America. Having obtained degrees in English, History, and Sociology at the University of the West Indies (UWI) in Mona, Jamaica, she later pivoted to communications and media studies. She went back to school in the mid-1980s at UWI campuses in Trinidad and Jamaica and studied abroad in the early 1990s at Michigan State University. Her essays on media include "Magical Realism: Television Theatre as Counter-media.”

In addition to publishing her own poetic, essayistic, and theatrical writing, she worked in radio and television production. Founding her own production company, Omnamedia, she stewarded over 100 TV productions, with a particular focus on local educational content.

Throughout her life, she taught in London, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago, where she made her long-term home.

While in London in the late 1960s, she worked as a secretary for the Caribbean Artists Movement, where she made connections with the who’s who in the arts, including Edward Brathwaite and Andrew Salkey. She also engaged in arts administration, eventually co-founding and presiding over the Writers Union of Trinidad and Tobago.

Her short fiction and poetry have been featured in publications such as *Wasafiri Magazine*, *The Heinemann Book of Caribbean Poetry*, *Whispers from the Cotton Tree Root: Caribbean Fabulist Fiction*, and *Breaklight: An Anthology of Caribbean Poetry*. Her standalone publications include *Decades to Ama* and *Chopstix in Mauby*.

Maxwell's first theater production dates back to 1959, entitled "Cane Arrowing," a "Words and Music programme" dramatizing the arrival of Christianity "to the Black Man in the New World." This production was staged at the University College of the West Indies (as UWI Mona was known before independence). Arrowing is agricultural terminology for the flowering or blooming of sugarcane; in the context of 1959, the symbolism suggests the country's imminent independence. Already present is a theme that would preoccupy Maxwell throughout her work: the synthesis of European and African cultural traditions in the Caribbean. Notably, the influential Jamaican playwright Dennis Scott was part of the production as an undergraduate student.

One of Maxwell’s enduring cultural contributions in the Caribbean was her founding of the "Yard Theatre." Embodied in her writing and production of *Play Mas’,* she reflected on her reinvention of folk theater in a paper delivered at the Caribbean Artists Movement symposium in 1967 on "West Indian Theatre" and later published it as an essay, "Towards a Revolution in the Arts," in the second issue of the journal *Savacou*. Maxwell was explicit about finding inspiration in the Trinidad Carnival. The essay claims “Carnival as a vehicle for political documentary theatre, political theatre, and art deeply involved in our political turmoil, for me the only truly relevant art at this point” (27). She saw Yard Theatre as “an attempt to place West Indian theatre in the life of the people, to find it in the yards where people live and are” (30).

“I see the drum at the center, and Carnival informing all the arts in the future. Out of this can come our painting, our sculpture, our theatre, our costuming, everything—and different and more exciting than anything ever produced before. Here is improvisation, here is surrealistic, naked, mad experiment and I repeat, here is synthesis."</p>

The play features a crew of men working to prepare their carnival float of an enormous butterfly (measuring fifteen feet) and is accompanied by a live steelpan band. The motley crew represents how artistic production can bring Caribbean society together in a synthesis of social differences. Prominent playwright Rawle Gibbons had a leading role in the production of "Play Mas'" at UWI Mona's Creative Arts Center.

Maxwell's work is often not sufficiently recognized among the pioneers of folk theater, despite her significant contributions. Although *Play Mas’* debuted to mixed reviews, Anne Walmsley has pointed out how the influence of Yard Theatre lived on in Jamaica, with the founding of Harambee Theatre by Frank Hasfal in 1972, and the opening of the Cultural Training Centre in 1975, where its ideas for theater were carried on by Dennis Scott, Rawle Gibbons, Honor Ford-Smith, and Thom Cross. Furthermore, Maxwell explored the parallels between her work and African-American experimental theater, citing influences such as LeRoi Jones’ (Amiri Baraka) Spirit House Movers and Barbara Ann Teer’s Harlem-based National Black Theatre.
