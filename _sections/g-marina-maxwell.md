Seemingly everywhere and nowhere, Marina Maxwell (née Archbald-Crichlow) is one of the unsung greats of Caribbean feminism and cultural activism. Born in Jamaica in 1934, she traveled widely in Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America. Having obtained degrees in English, History, and Sociology at UWI Mona in Jamaica, she later pivoted to communications and media studies. She went back to school in the mid-1980s at UWI in Trinidad and Jamaica and studied abroad in the early 1990s at Michigan State University.

In addition to her own poetic, essayistic, and theatrical writing, she has worked in radio and television production (founding her own production company, Omnamedia), producing over 100 TV productions, with a particular focus on local educational content. Her essays on media include "Magical Realism: Television Theatre as Counter-media".

While in London, she worked as a secretary for the Caribbean Artists Movement, where she made connections with the who’s who in the arts, including Edward Brathwaite and Andrew Salkey. She also engaged in arts administration, eventually co-founding and presiding over the Writers Union of Trinidad and Tobago.

Throughout her life, she taught in London, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago, where she made her long-term home.

Her short fiction and poetry have been featured in publications such as *Wasafiri Magazine*, *The Heinemann Book of Caribbean Poetry*, *Whispers from the Cotton Tree Root: Caribbean Fabulist Fiction*, and *Breaklight: An Anthology of Caribbean Poetry*. Her standalone publications include *Decades to Ama* and *Chopstix in Mauby*.
