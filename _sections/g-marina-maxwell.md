Seemingly everywhere and nowhere, Marina Maxwell (née Archbald-Crichlow) is one of the unsung greats of Caribbean feminism and cultural activism. Born in Jamaica in 1934, she traveled widely in Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America. Having obtained degrees in English, History, and Sociology at the University of the West Indies (UWI) in Mona, Jamaica, she later pivoted to communications and media studies. She went back to school in the mid-1980s at UWI campuses in Trinidad and Jamaica and studied abroad in the early 1990s at Michigan State University. Her essays on media include "Magical Realism: Television Theatre as Counter-media.”

In addition to publishing her own poetic, essayistic, and theatrical writing, she worked in radio and television production. Founding her own production company, Omnamedia, she stewarded over 100 TV productions, with a particular focus on local educational content.

Throughout her life, she taught in London, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago, where she made her long-term home.

While in London in the late 1960s, she worked as a secretary for the Caribbean Artists Movement, where she made connections with the who’s who in the arts, including Edward Brathwaite and Andrew Salkey. She also engaged in arts administration, eventually co-founding and presiding over the Writers Union of Trinidad and Tobago.

Her short fiction and poetry have been featured in publications such as *Wasafiri Magazine*, *The Heinemann Book of Caribbean Poetry*, *Whispers from the Cotton Tree Root: Caribbean Fabulist Fiction*, and *Breaklight: An Anthology of Caribbean Poetry*. Her standalone publications include *Decades to Ama* and *Chopstix in Mauby*.

Maxwell's first theater production dates back to 1959, entitled "Cane Arrowing," a "Words and Music programme" dramatizing the arrival of Christianity "to the Black Man in the New World." This production was staged at the University College of the West Indies (as UWI Mona was known before independence). Arrowing is agricultural terminology for the flowering or blooming of sugarcane; in the context of 1959, the symbolism suggests the country's imminent independence. Already present is a theme that would preoccupy Maxwell throughout her work: the synthesis of European and African cultural traditions in the Caribbean. Notably, the influential Jamaican playwright Dennis Scott was part of the production as an undergraduate student.

One of Maxwell’s enduring cultural contributions in the Caribbean was her founding of the "Yard Theatre." Embodied in her writing and production of *Play Mas’,* she reflected on her reinvention of folk theater in a paper delivered at the Caribbean Artists Movement symposium in 1967 on "West Indian Theatre" and later published it as an essay, "Towards a Revolution in the Arts," in the second issue of the journal *Savacou*. Maxwell was explicit about finding inspiration in the Trinidad Carnival. The essay claims “Carnival as a vehicle for political documentary theatre, political theatre, and art deeply involved in our political turmoil, for me the only truly relevant art at this point” (27). She saw Yard Theatre as “an attempt to place West Indian theatre in the life of the people, to find it in the yards where people live and are” (30).

“I see the drum at the center, and Carnival informing all the arts in the future. Out of this can come our painting, our sculpture, our theatre, our costuming, everything—and different and more exciting than anything ever produced before. Here is improvisation, here is surrealistic, naked, mad experiment and I repeat, here is synthesis."</p>

The play features a crew of men working to prepare their carnival float of an enormous butterfly (measuring fifteen feet) and is accompanied by a live steelpan band. The motley crew represents how artistic production can bring Caribbean society together in a synthesis of social differences. Prominent playwright Rawle Gibbons had a leading role in the production of "Play Mas'" at UWI Mona's Creative Arts Center.

Maxwell's work is often not sufficiently recognized among the pioneers of folk theater, despite her significant contributions. Although *Play Mas’* debuted to mixed reviews, Anne Walmsley has pointed out how the influence of Yard Theatre lived on in Jamaica, with the founding of Harambee Theatre by Frank Hasfal in 1972, and the opening of the Cultural Training Centre in 1975, where its ideas for theater were carried on by Dennis Scott, Rawle Gibbons, Honor Ford-Smith, and Thom Cross. Furthermore, Maxwell explored the parallels between her work and African-American experimental theater, citing influences such as LeRoi Jones’ (Amiri Baraka) Spirit House Movers and Barbara Ann Teer’s Harlem-based National Black Theatre.

Maxwell would bring these ideas about theater to writers' conferences abroad, including two visits to Cuba and her travels around Africa. At the 1974 ACLALS (Association for Commonwealth Literature and Language Studies) conference at Makerere University in Uganda, she was the sole female delegate, and one of three representatives of the Caribbean (along with Arthur Drayton and Kenneth Ramchand). Maxwell must have exchanged ideas about the resonances between her Yard Theater and African theater traditions with such icons of postcolonial African writing as Chinua Achebe Nuruddin Farah, and Peter Nazareth.[^maxwell-1] She produced interviews with some of these African writers for the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation (JBC). The conference also led her to propose a "Third World Cultural Department" under the Organization for African Unity. Though initially fruitless, we shall see how the proposal resurfaces in various forms over the years.

In 1975, Maxwell was invited as a "teatrista" (theater practitioner) to the "Encuentro de Escritores Latinoamericanos" (Meeting of Latin-American Writers) in Cuba, February 1975. On her first visit to the island, she joined a select group of Anglophone Caribbean writers, including Arthur Seymour and Edward Brathwaite. Her presentation, titled "Towards Third World Cultural Synthesis," was praised in the Cuban press.[^maxwell-2] 

Her invitation to CARIFESTA 1979 in Cuba almost certainly resulted from the connections she had made there in 1975. The two-day symposium on “Caribbean Artistic and Literary Identity” (“Simposio sobre la Identidad del Arte y la Cultura del Caribe”) on 18-19 July drew a crowd of around 500 people and featured 21 writers and intellectuals.

Once again the sole woman on a roster of distinguished speakers, Maxwell contributed to the symposium by calling on her fellow writers to revive and expand the original Caribbean Artists Movement (CAM) to the wider region. The movement lay dormant since 1972, when Edward Brathwaite’s attempts to bring CAM to Jamaica had fallen on deaf ears. In her talk, “Towards a Caribbean Artists Movement,” she described her proposal in great detail. She hoped "to produce out of CARIFESTA, Havana, Cuba 1979, the foundation and nucleus of a network, a movement of Caribbean artists. I propose a CARIFESTA Resolution to set up a Committee to work out the logistics.” Though she is not acknowledged explicitly, Maxwell's call initiated the resolution that the symposium speakers eventually signed and addressed to their respective governments, urging the continued support of CARIFESTA.[^maxwell-3]

Her 1981 book *About Our Own Business* gathered the aforementioned talks, edited versions of the interviews with African writers from 1974, and other essays and speeches that she delivered between the years 1974-1980. She had written to John La Rose of New Beacon Books to pitch a publication of her African interviews as early as 1974, but he eventually declined. Ever-persistent, Maxwell published the book herself under the label Drum Mountain. At the next CARIFESTA (1981 in Barbados), Maxwell brought *About Our Own Business* to display and sell at the festival's book exhibit.

The 1981 edition of CARIFESTA in Barbados was the first to host a space in the festival specifically dedicated to Caribbean women artists and intellectuals. It was one of the pioneering Caribbean feminist symposiums. Sponsored by the Barbados Ministry of Education and Culture, as well as the new Department of Women's Affairs and the Women in Development Unit at UWI Cave Hill, the "Women in Culture" brought together newer and older generations of female Caribbean artists and intellectuals, such as Louise Bennett, Olive Lewin, Ivy Baxter, and the Sistren Theatre. Here, Maxwell was given the recognition she sought and deserved.

Described as one of the Caribbean’s “cultural midwives,” Maxwell gave a stirring, heartfelt, and erudite keynote address titled “The Weakened Sex.” She was given over an hour to speak. Her argument about the conditions of Caribbean womanhood can be understood as what we might now call transnational feminism: 
<blockquote class="blockquote d-flex flex-column align-items-center">
<p>
“In the same way that the centre nations have emerged as colonizers and exploiters of the periphery nations of the 3rd world, so too have men colonized and dominated and exploited women over the last centuries, sometimes with the best of intentions. [...] We not only have to declare black, which we are, in all shades and sizes and levels of consciousness, and which in the Caribbean is cardinal to our wholeness, individuation, creativity, claiming of our freedoms and identities but we also have to declare, claim, live and struggle for liberation of the black woman artist."</p>
