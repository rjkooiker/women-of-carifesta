## Introduction: Women of Carifesta

Chances are that you haven’t heard of the Caribbean Festival of Arts, one of the largest regional festivals of culture in the Caribbean. Starting in Guyana in 1972, the festival has traveled widely around the region over its 50-year history, including editions in Jamaica, Barbados, Cuba, Suriname, and Trinidad & Tobago. As scholars learn more about the history of this festival, it’s becoming clear that it could never have happened without the artistic contributions and organizational work of Caribbean women. Despite prevailing inequalities and bias, women at Carifesta also found opportunities to launch their careers and stage their art in front of thousands. 

This exhibit sheds light on many of those women for the first time, ranging from the first festival in Guyana to the 1981 festival in Barbados. Focusing on these women's work and voices shows how many of the Carifesta events elevated the work of men and heroic masculinity as ideals the region’s people should strive toward, often excluding women in the process. When women were featured, they had stereotypes to contend with–even well-known artists such as Louise Bennett. 

This exhibit displays original historical documents and recordings, offering insights into Carifesta’s past. However, existing Carifesta archives often skew toward that male-centric view. That’s why, along with deep archival research, I’ve conducted interviews with women who were first-hand witnesses and participants in the events of Carifesta. Their memories can go beyond paper traces and bring the festivals to life.

## Lynette Dolphin

In 1966, the Prime Minister of Guyana, Forbes Burnham, delivered a speech to Caribbean artists and writers which has commonly been considered the origin of the Carifesta festival idea. While no women were recorded as attending this meeting, Lynette deWeever Dolphin, Joan Cambridge, Magda Pollard, and Shirley Field-Ridley were crucial to the effort to realize Carifesta ‘72.

The second-ever Guyanese recipient of a scholarship to attend London’s Royal Academy of Music, Lynette Dolphin was an anthologist of Guyanese folk music and an accomplished pianist who performed with the ensemble for the “Legend of Kaieteur,” the Guyanese chorale by Philip Pilgrim. For many years, she led the Guyanese National History and Arts Council.

In 1970, Burnham organized a second meeting of Caribbean artists and writers to formulate policy recommendations for the festival. Lynette Dolphin chaired the Music and Dance Sub-Committee. As the official Carifesta Secretariat was assembled, she became Carifesta Director.

In preparation for Carifesta, Dolphin visited numerous Caribbean and Latin American countries, including Suriname, Chile, Peru, and Brazil, persuading governments to send their best artists to Guyana, and asked numerous writers to send contributions to the Carifesta anthology of Caribbean literature.

One of Dolphin’s most significant trips abroad was to Brazil, where she spent two weeks. The *Ballet Folclórico Viva Bahia*, part of the Brazilian delegation, was one of the most anticipated groups at Carifesta. After touring their new choreography *Odoiá Bahia: A Folk-Pop Spectacle* around Brazil, which included elements of capoeira, candomblé, and samba de roda, the group took their two-hour show to the Carifesta stage. Recognizing Dolphin’s efforts, a member of the group gifted her a bouquet of flowers at the Carifesta closing ceremonies.

Based on the success of Carifesta ‘72, the Cuban government invited Dolphin to Havana to advise on preparations for the 1979 edition of Carifesta. During that festival, Edward Kamau Brathwaite, the Barbadian poet and frequent Carifesta participant, had called her the “MOTHER OF CARIFESTA.”
